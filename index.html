        <h1 style="font-size:40px"> What is <strong>Self-Esteem?</strong></h1>
         <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;"><i><b>Self-esteem</b></i> refers to <u><b>how we perceive ourselves and the value we place on ourselves</b></u>. We all criticize ourselves from time to time, but if you constantly judge yourself harshly, you may have poor self-esteem. You may not know what is causing your poor self-esteem, but there are ways for you to get over it.</p>

         <br><h1 style="font-size:40px"> What is Public Speaking?</h1>
          <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;"><i><b>Public speaking</b></i> anxiety can hinder personal and professional growth, limiting opportunities for advancement and self-expression. Students may shy away from class presentations, while workplaces may decline leadership roles or career advancements. A student's ability to keep a happy attitude, interact with their audience, and speak coherently while expressing their thoughts is referred to as their <u>public speaking competence</u>. Students may be asked to host public speaking events like presentations, conferences, or special events; therefore, these abilities are crucial to the job. A lack of confidence in public speaking stems from a <b>fear</b> of criticism or a belief that you are not competent enough. With more self-assurance, your attention turns from whether the audience likes you to developing rapport and connecting with your audience as soon as you begin speaking. </p>

         <br><h1 style="font-size:40px">Why a person has trouble communicating in a large audience?</h1>
          <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">Many public <b>speakers lack confidence</b> when stepping on stage is because <u>they are focused on whether or not they will somehow “screw up”</u>. The thing is, you shouldn’t be focused on yourself at all. Having confidence comes from focusing on your audience, their needs, their problems, and how you can help them solve them. A confident speaker knows the audience members see him as an authority and want him to be successful. <i>His success ultimately means their success </i><b>(Arora, 2019)</b>. <br>
<br><b>Low self-confidence</b> is another public speaking <i>weakness</i>. It often stems from a fear of inadequacy or a belief that one’s ideas are not valuable enough to share. This lack of confidence can lead to hesitancy and a lack of conviction in delivering the message <b>(GradesFixer, 2023)</b>. Building public speaking confidence needs both <em>self-awareness</em> and <em>self-improvement</em>. It all started with identifying your speaking talents and weaknesses. Concentrate on your strengths first, then work on your weaknesses gradually. Joining a public speaking club or taking a course might offer you a supportive environment in which to improve your confidence.

           <h1 style="font-size:40px">What are the ways to improve self esteem as well as public speaking?</h1>
           <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">These are <b>The Eight tactics</b> to help bolster your <b><i>self-esteem.</i></b> Think about which ones you'd like to start implementing in your daily life. But don't stop there: remember that the best way to achieve healthy self-esteem is to focus less on esteem and more on <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/self-compassion?hsLang=en"target="blank"><i>practicing self-compassion </i></a> and <a href=https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-overcome-insecurities?hsLang=en" target="blank"><i>improving self-confidence.</i></a></p><br>
           
             <h2>1. Write out a list of things you admire about yourself</h2>
              <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">It can be challenging to sit down and think about our admirable traits — even awkward. But acknowledging your skills or things you like about yourself can improve your self-talk.<br>

<br>Try <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-start-journaling?hsLang=en">keeping a journal of things</a> you've done that you enjoyed or admired. Gratitude journals also work wonders for improving your outlook on life and recognizing what you have to be thankful for.<br>

<br>Don't just write down any <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/positive-affirmations">positive affirmation</a> you come across. Instead, look for relevant affirmations and consider how to <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/Self-acceptance?hsLang=en">accept yourself</a>. What is it that you appreciate and admire? Remember these attributes when you notice your mind fills with negative thoughts. Avoid generic mantras and focus on phrases meaningful to you.</p>

             <br> <h2>2. Stop being a people pleaser</h2>
               <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">People with poor self-esteem can feel obligated to say yes to requests. They often put helping others before their own mental health. This can lead to being <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/why-i-am-easily-overwhelmed">easily overwhelmed</a>, whether that’s at work or in your personal life. That, in turn, causes a lot of stress.<br>

<br>It's nice to be helpful and supportive when you can, but your self-esteem eventually suffers when you tie your self-worth to how much you do for others. Learn <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-say-no?hsLang=en">how to say no to others.</a>
            
             <br> <h2>3. Step outside your comfort zone</h2>
               <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">Those with low self-esteem tend to avoid challenges and new opportunities. This can be due to fears or self-doubt. But when you succeed in any big or small way, you show yourself that you can persevere through rough moments.

<br><a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/get-comfortable-being-uncomfortable?hsLang=en">Stepping outside your comfort zone</a> doesn't mean that you have to throw yourself into highly uncomfortable situations. It means you're willing to try new things even if you enter difficult situations.</p>

             <br> <h2>4. Stop comparing yourself to others</h2>
              <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">Your progress and self-worth shouldn’t be connected to how well other people are doing. There will always be someone better at something than you, but that doesn’t mean you’re not good at what you do, or good enough. <br>

<img style="display: block;

<br>It's not easy to <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/comparing-yourself-to-others?hsLang=en">stop comparing yourself to others</a>. But staying away from social media can help this effort. If you do scroll, remind yourself that people only share the best, most flattering parts of their life online. Don't let likes on a photo dictate your self-worth. Practice an occasional <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/digital-detox">digital detox </a>to reduce your exposure.<br>

<br>Appreciate your differences compared to others, but remember that you’re not in competition with anyone else’s progress.</p>

            <br> <h2>5. Forgive yourself for your past thoughts</h2>
             <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">As you work to build your self-esteem, you need to forgive yourself for how you treated yourself before. You can't move forward with your progress without accepting that you used to judge yourself and others harshly. It's a hard habit to break.
<br>
<br>Acknowledging this weakness exercises <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-self-compassion-strengthens-resilience?hsLang=en">self-compassion and resilience </a> by helping you see yourself clearly. You’re building a more solid foundation when you choose to have a healthier relationship with yourself.</p>

            <br> <h2>6. Set boundaries in your relationships</h2>
             <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">Think about what your boundaries are in your personal and professional life. To have higher self-esteem, you need to understand what your boundaries look like and how they align with your values.<br>

<br>Plus, you'll need to think about how you'll respond when people cross them because that'll happen — intentionally or not. <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/healthy-boundaries-in-relationships">Setting boundaries</a> is a way of not letting others control or take advantage of you and practicing assertiveness. <br>

<br>Learning how to set boundaries at work may look different than in your personal life. You can mute notifications when the workday ends to maintain your work-life balance, but you can’t avoid your friends when you don’t know how to be firm with them. Be patient, and be honest.</p>

            <br> <h2>7. Celebrate your wins</h2>
             <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">Victories come in all sizes, and you should celebrate them all. Did you practice some positive self-talk today? Did you banish some negative beliefs or face one of your fears? Acknowledge those feelings of confidence and pride, and embrace them. It'll help your self-confidence grow and show you that building self-esteem helps you feel more comfortable with yourself.</p>


            <br> <h2>8. Let go of negative people</h2>
             <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:100px; font-size:20px;">It's one thing to let go of negative thoughts, but have you thought about letting negative people go? The people you surround yourself with have a big impact on your mood and level of self-esteem.<br>

<br>If people constantly remind you of your flaws, make fun of your mistakes, or fill you with self-doubt, you'll have poor self-esteem. But letting those influences go will allow more positive encouragement and kinder thoughts to help grow your self-esteem. And once you identify someone’s <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/toxic-traits">toxic traits</a>, it’s hard to see past them.</p>
